									<p>I was born and grew up in Kabul in an artistic family with my father who is a sculptor.  That was the drive that I perused art as my career. I studied   fine arts and sculpture in Kabul, shortly I moved to Ireland and continued to study design. I received my BA in Visual Communication Design from Dun Laoghair Institute of Art, Design & Technology in Dublin. At the moment I live in London looking to build my career in design field.  I am very passionate to work with innovative, creative projects with social, educational themes.
